========

This is a forked version of [dockprom](https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom) for use in memory limited environments. The main difference from dockprom itself is do not restart or launch services automatically, only launch them piecewise upon demand.

See [the original article](https://monkeysatkeyboards.com/blog/cheap-analytics-prometheu-grafana) for details.
